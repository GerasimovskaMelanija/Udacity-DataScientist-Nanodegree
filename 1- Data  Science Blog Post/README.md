# Description:
This dataset is from Kaggle and can be used for different discussion, like exploring and understanding the global temperature, as well as the temperature for a specific country or city. In this project, we are using two files of the dataset: GlobalTemperatures.csv (Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures) and GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv (Global Average Land Temperature by Country). 
The first file contains average, min and max land temperature, as well average land and ocean temperature.
The second file contains average temperatures for different countries.

# Using this dataset, we want to answer three questions:
1. Did the average temperature of the land increased over years?
2. Which country has the highest average temperature, and which country has the lowest?
3. Is there Global Warming?

# Results
First, an analysis for the average global land temperature was made, and we came to a conclusion that the temperature of the land increased over the years, especially over the last 30 years. That is a indicator for a Global Warming. After that, an analysis for the average temperature of the countries was made, where we get the information about the country that has the higest average temperature and the country that has the lowest average temperature. We plot the changes of the temperature over the years for the two countries and we came to the same conclusion like in the first analysis. The conclusion is that the Global Warming is really happening and we have to take actions to stop it.
